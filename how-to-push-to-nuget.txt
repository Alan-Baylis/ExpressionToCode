to publish, run the following commands in the library  directory:
    
    dotnet pack -c release --include-symbols --include-source
    dotnet nuget push .\bin\Release\ExpressionToCodeLib.<version>.nupkg -s https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package

 You must also have configured your nuget api-key, e.g. via  NuGet.exe setApiKey <your-api-key-here>.  The api key is saved in your profile, so you need to do that only once.
